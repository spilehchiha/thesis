	Abstract = {We present atomic trade protocols for Bitcoin and Ethereum that can bind two parties to swap coins in the event that two blockchains emerge from a single ``pre-fork'' blockchain. This work is motivated by a bet between two members of the Bitcoin community, Loaded and Roger Ver, to trade 60,000 bitcoins in the event that Bitcoin Unlimited's planned hardfork occurs and the blockchain splits into two distinct forks. Additionally we study several ways to provide replay protection in the event of hardfork alongside a novel mechanism called migration inputs. We provide a detailed survey and history of previous softforks and hardforks in Ethereum and Bitcoin.},

	Abstract = {Trustworthy generation of public random numbers is necessary for the security of a number of cryptographic applications. It was suggested to use the inherent unpredictability of blockchains as a source of public randomness. Entropy from the Bitcoin blockchain in particular has been used in lotteries and has been suggested for a number of other applications ranging from smart contracts to election auditing. In this Arcticle, we analyse this idea and show how an adversary could manipulate these random numbers, even with limited computational power and financial budget.},

	Abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts are considered a promising technology for handling financial agreements securely. In order to realize this vision, we need a formal language to unambiguously describe contract clauses. We introduce Findel -- a purely declarative financial domain-specific language (DSL) well suited for implementation in blockchain networks. We implement an Ethereum smart contract that acts as a marketplace for Findel contracts and measure the cost of its operation. We analyze challenges in modeling financial agreements in decentralized networks and outline directions for future work (See the author's post-print at https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/30975and the related source code at https://github.com/cryptolu/findel).},

	Abstract = {We consider a prediction market in which all aspects are controlled by market forces, in particular the correct outcomes of events are decided by the market itself rather than by trusted arbiters. This kind of a decentralized prediction market can sustain betting on events whose outcome may remain unresolved for a long or even unlimited time period, and can facilitate trades among participants who are spread across diverse geographical locations, may wish to remain anonymous and/or avoid burdensome identification procedures, and are distrustful of each other. We describe how a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can be enhanced to accommodate a truly decentralized prediction market, by employing an innovative variant of the Colored Coins concept. We examine the game-theoretic properties of our design, and offer extensions that enable other financial instruments as well as real-time exchange.},

@inproceedings{ECH12,
	Abstract = {We propose and study the notion of concurrent ballot authorization for coercion-resistant, end-to-end verifi- able (E2E) internet voting. A central part of providing coercion resistance is the ability for an election authority to filter out fake ballots from legitimate ones in a way that is both private and universally verifiable. This ballot authorization process, however, can potentially come at a heavy computational cost. In previous proposals, the bulk of this computation cannot be performed until the last ballot has been cast. By contrast, concurrent ballot authorization allows ballots to be authorized as they are submitted, allowing the tally to be declared immediately after polls close. An efficient tally is especially impor- tant in the coercion-resistant internet voting setting, as it is particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks caused by floods of fake ballots.
	<p></p>
	We present a proof-of-concept voting system, Cobra, the first coercion-resistant system to offer concurrent ballot authorization. Although Cobra offers the fastest tallying relative to the related work, it has a registration process that we consider to be too slow to be viable; one that is quadratic in the number of eligible voters. We present Cobra as a first-step toward what we hope will become a standard feature of coercion-resistant internet voting schemes: concurrent ballot authorization.},
